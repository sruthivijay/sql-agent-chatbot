To create the initial migration script for setting up the database in the `/sql-chatbot-app/sql-chatbot-app/db/migrations/0001_init.sql` file, we will define the necessary SQL commands to create the required tables for the chatbot application. 

Hereâ€™s the plan for the migration script:

1. **Create Users Table**: This table will store user information.
2. **Create Messages Table**: This table will store messages exchanged in the chat.
3. **Create Sessions Table**: This table will manage chat sessions.

Once you confirm this plan, I will generate the SQL commands for you. Would you like to proceed with this structure?
