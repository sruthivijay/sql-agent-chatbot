To seed the database with initial data for your chatbot project, I will create the contents for the file `/sql-chatbot-app/sql-chatbot-app/db/seed.sql`. This file will include SQL commands to insert sample data into the relevant tables.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the `seed.sql` file:

1. **Define Sample Data**: Identify the tables that need initial data and create sample entries for them.
2. **Insert Statements**: Write SQL `INSERT` statements to populate these tables with the sample data.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have specific tables and data in mind that you would like to include in the `seed.sql` file.
