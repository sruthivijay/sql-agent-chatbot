To create the `llm.ts` file for the chatbot project, we will implement a service that interacts with a language model. This service will be responsible for processing user input and generating responses based on data retrieved from the SQL database.

### Plan for `llm.ts`:
1. **Import Required Modules**: We will import necessary modules, including any libraries for interacting with the language model and the database.
2. **Define the LLM Service Class**: Create a class that encapsulates the logic for interacting with the language model.
3. **Implement Methods**:
   - A method to generate a response based on user input.
   - A method to format the input data appropriately for the language model.
4. **Export the Service**: Ensure the service can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

Would you like to proceed with this plan and generate the contents for `llm.ts`?
