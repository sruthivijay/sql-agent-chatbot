To create the `retriever.ts` file for your chatbot project, we will implement a service that connects to a SQL database and retrieves data based on user queries. This service will be designed to work with either the Direct SQL or RAG over SQL architecture.

### Plan for `retriever.ts`:
1. **Database Connection**: Import the database connection module to interact with the SQL database.
2. **Query Execution**: Create functions to execute SQL queries and retrieve results.
3. **Data Formatting**: Format the retrieved data into a structure suitable for the chatbot's responses.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage any issues that arise during database interactions.

Once you confirm this plan, I will proceed to generate the contents of the `retriever.ts` file. Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any modifications in mind!
