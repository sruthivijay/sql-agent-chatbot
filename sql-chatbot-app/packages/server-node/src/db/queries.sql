To create the SQL queries file for your chatbot project, we will include some basic SQL queries that the application might use to interact with the database. This could include queries for fetching chat history, user information, or specific responses based on user input.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the contents of the `/sql-chatbot-app/sql-chatbot-app/packages/server-node/src/db/queries.sql` file:

1. **Fetch All Responses**: A query to retrieve all possible responses from the database.
2. **Fetch Response by User Input**: A query to get a specific response based on user input.
3. **Insert New User Message**: A query to log a new user message into the database.
4. **Fetch Chat History**: A query to retrieve the chat history for a specific user.

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any specific queries you want to include!
