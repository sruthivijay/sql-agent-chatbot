To create the `index.ts` file for the database connection in your Node.js chatbot application, I will implement a basic setup that connects to a SQL database using a popular library like `pg` for PostgreSQL or `mysql` for MySQL. This file will handle the database connection and export the connection for use in other parts of the application.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the `index.ts` file:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries for database connection.
2. **Create Database Connection**: Set up the connection to the SQL database using environment variables for configuration.
3. **Export the Connection**: Export the connection object for use in other modules.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any specific requirements or preferences!
