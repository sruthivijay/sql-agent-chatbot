To create the `pyproject.toml` file for the Python server implementation of your chatbot project, we will define the necessary dependencies and configurations. Here's the plan:

### Plan for `pyproject.toml`
1. **Project Metadata**: Include the project name, version, and description.
2. **Dependencies**: Specify the required libraries for the chatbot functionality, such as Flask or FastAPI for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and any other necessary libraries.
3. **Development Dependencies**: Include testing libraries like pytest and any other tools needed for development.

Once you confirm this plan, I will generate the contents for the `pyproject.toml` file. Would you like to proceed with this plan?
