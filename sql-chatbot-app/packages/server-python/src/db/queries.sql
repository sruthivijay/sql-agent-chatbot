To create the SQL queries file for the chatbot project, I will include a basic structure with example queries that could be used to interact with the SQL database. This will include queries for fetching responses based on user input, as well as any necessary setup for the chatbot functionality.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the `queries.sql` file:

1. **Select Query**: A query to fetch a response based on user input.
2. **Insert Query**: A query to log user interactions or store new responses.
3. **Update Query**: A query to update existing responses if needed.
4. **Delete Query**: A query to remove outdated responses.

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any specific queries in mind that you want to include!
