To create the `app.py` file for the Python server implementation of the chatbot, I will set up a basic Flask application that connects to a SQL database and defines routes for handling chat requests. Here's the plan:

### Plan for `app.py`
1. **Import Required Libraries**: Import Flask and any necessary extensions for database connection.
2. **Initialize Flask App**: Create an instance of the Flask application.
3. **Database Connection**: Set up a connection to the SQL database using a separate connection module.
4. **Define Routes**: Create a route for handling chat requests, which will interact with the retriever service to fetch responses.
5. **Run the Application**: Include a main block to run the application.

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any modifications in mind!
