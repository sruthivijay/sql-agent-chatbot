To create the `llm.py` file for the Python server implementation of the chatbot, we will implement a basic structure that allows interaction with a language model. This file will include functions to generate responses based on user input and potentially leverage data from the SQL database.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the `llm.py` file:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We will import libraries for handling requests and interacting with the language model.
2. **Define Functions**:
   - A function to initialize the language model.
   - A function to generate responses based on user input.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for robustness.

Now, I will generate the contents for the `llm.py` file. 

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any modifications in mind!
