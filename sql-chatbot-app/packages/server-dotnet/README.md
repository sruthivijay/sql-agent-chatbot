# README for SQL Chatbot Application

This project is a chatbot application that interacts with a SQL database to provide responses based on user input. It supports multiple implementations using different frameworks and architectures.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **.env.example**: Example of environment variables needed for the application.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project, including architectural details.
- **db/**: Contains SQL schema, seed data, and migration scripts.
- **variants/**: Different implementation variants of the chatbot.
- **packages/**: Different server implementations (Node.js, Python, .NET, and Next.js).
- **tests/**: Contains test files for API and end-to-end testing.
- **docker/**: Docker-related files for setting up the application environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sql-chatbot-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For Node.js:
     ```
     cd packages/server-node
     npm install
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```
     cd packages/server-python
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For .NET:
     ```
     cd packages/server-dotnet
     dotnet restore
     ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials.
   - Run the SQL scripts in the `db/` directory to set up the schema and seed data.

4. **Run the application**:
   - For Node.js:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```
     python src/app.py
     ```
   - For .NET:
     ```
     dotnet run
     ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Access the chatbot through the defined API endpoints.
- Refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory for detailed architectural information and usage examples.

## Architectural Options

1. **Direct SQL Approach**: 
   - Frameworks: Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or FastAPI, .NET with ASP.NET Core.
   - Directly queries the SQL database to fetch responses based on user input.

2. **RAG Over SQL Approach**: 
   - Frameworks: Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or FastAPI, .NET with ASP.NET Core.
   - Combines SQL queries with a language model to generate more contextually relevant responses.

Choose the architecture and framework that best fits your needs and expertise. Happy coding!
