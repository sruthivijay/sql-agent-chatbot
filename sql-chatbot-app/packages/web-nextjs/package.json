To create the `package.json` file for the Next.js frontend implementation of your chatbot project, I will include the necessary dependencies and scripts for a typical Next.js application. Here's the plan:

### Plan for `package.json`
1. **Project Metadata**: Include the name, version, and description of the project.
2. **Dependencies**: Add essential dependencies for Next.js, React, and any other libraries that might be useful for a chatbot application (like Axios for API calls).
3. **Scripts**: Define scripts for starting the development server, building the application, and running tests.
4. **DevDependencies**: Include TypeScript and any other development tools if needed.

Once you confirm this plan, I will generate the contents for the `package.json` file. Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any specific requirements!
