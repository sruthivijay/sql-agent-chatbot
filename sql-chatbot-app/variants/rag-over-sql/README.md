# README for RAG Over SQL Variant

This README provides an overview of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach over SQL for the chatbot project. This variant combines traditional SQL querying with advanced language model capabilities to enhance the chatbot's responses.

## Overview

The RAG over SQL variant leverages a SQL database to retrieve relevant information based on user queries and then utilizes a language model to generate contextually rich responses. This approach aims to provide more accurate and informative answers by integrating structured data retrieval with natural language processing.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **SQL Database**: Stores structured data that the chatbot can query.
- **Retriever Service**: Responsible for querying the SQL database and fetching relevant data based on user input.
- **Language Model Service**: Processes the retrieved data and generates a natural language response.
- **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints for the frontend to interact with the chatbot.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sql-chatbot-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     cd packages/server-node
     npm install
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```bash
     cd packages/server-python
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create a SQL database and run the schema and seed files located in the `db` directory to initialize the database.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required variables.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```bash
     python src/app.py
     ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Send a POST request to the chatbot API endpoint with the user's query.
- The API will return a generated response based on the retrieved data from the SQL database.

## Conclusion

The RAG over SQL variant provides a powerful way to enhance chatbot interactions by combining structured data retrieval with advanced language processing capabilities. This approach can be tailored further based on specific project requirements and user feedback.
