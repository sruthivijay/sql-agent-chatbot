# End-to-End Testing Documentation

This document provides an overview of the end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy for the SQL Chatbot application. E2E tests are designed to validate the complete flow of the application, ensuring that all components work together as expected.

## Purpose

The purpose of E2E testing is to simulate real user scenarios and verify that the application behaves correctly from the user's perspective. This includes testing the interaction between the frontend and backend, as well as the integration with the SQL database.

## Testing Framework

For E2E testing, we will use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as the testing framework. Cypress is a powerful tool for writing and running E2E tests in JavaScript, providing an easy-to-use interface and robust features.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Cypress**: 
   Navigate to the root of the project and run the following command to install Cypress:

   ```
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

2. **Open Cypress**: 
   After installation, you can open Cypress using the command:

   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```

   This will launch the Cypress Test Runner.

3. **Write Tests**: 
   Create your E2E tests in the `tests/e2e` directory. You can create a new test file with a `.spec.js` extension.

4. **Run Tests**: 
   You can run your tests directly from the Cypress Test Runner or via the command line:

   ```
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Test Scenarios

Here are some example scenarios to consider for E2E testing:

- **User Interaction**: Test the user interface by simulating user inputs and verifying the expected outputs.
- **API Integration**: Ensure that the frontend correctly communicates with the backend API and handles responses appropriately.
- **Database Interaction**: Validate that the application correctly retrieves and displays data from the SQL database.
- **Error Handling**: Test how the application behaves under error conditions, such as invalid inputs or server errors.

## Conclusion

E2E testing is a critical part of the development process for the SQL Chatbot application. By following the setup instructions and writing comprehensive tests, we can ensure that the application functions correctly and provides a seamless experience for users.
