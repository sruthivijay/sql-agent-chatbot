To create the HTTP test file for the chat API, we will include test cases that simulate requests to the chatbot's endpoint. This will help ensure that the API behaves as expected when interacting with the SQL database.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the `chat.test.http` file:

1. **Define the API Endpoint**: Specify the endpoint for the chat API.
2. **Create Test Cases**: Include various test cases to cover different scenarios, such as:
   - A successful chat request with valid input.
   - A request with invalid input to test error handling.
   - A request to check the response when no data is found.

Once you confirm this plan, I will generate the contents for the `chat.test.http` file. Please let me know if you would like to proceed!
