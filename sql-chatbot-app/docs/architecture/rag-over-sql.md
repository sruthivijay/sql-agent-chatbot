# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Over SQL Architecture

## Overview
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines traditional SQL querying with advanced language models to enhance the chatbot's ability to provide contextually relevant responses. This architecture leverages the strengths of both structured data retrieval and generative capabilities of language models.

## Architecture Components
1. **User Interface**: 
   - A frontend application (e.g., built with Next.js) that allows users to interact with the chatbot.
   - Sends user queries to the backend server.

2. **Backend Server**:
   - Implemented using frameworks such as Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/FastAPI), or .NET (ASP.NET Core).
   - Receives user queries and processes them to fetch relevant data from the SQL database.
   - Integrates with a language model to generate responses based on the retrieved data.

3. **SQL Database**:
   - Stores structured data that the chatbot can query to provide factual information.
   - The database schema is defined in `db/schema.sql`, and initial data can be seeded using `db/seed.sql`.

4. **Retriever Service**:
   - A service responsible for executing SQL queries against the database.
   - Retrieves relevant data based on user input and prepares it for the language model.

5. **Language Model Service**:
   - Interacts with a pre-trained language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to generate responses.
   - Takes the retrieved data as context to produce more accurate and relevant answers.

## Workflow
1. The user submits a query through the frontend interface.
2. The backend server receives the query and invokes the retriever service.
3. The retriever service executes SQL queries to fetch relevant data from the database.
4. The retrieved data is passed to the language model service.
5. The language model generates a response based on the context provided by the retrieved data.
6. The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Advantages
- **Contextual Relevance**: By combining SQL data retrieval with generative capabilities, the chatbot can provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Flexibility**: This architecture allows for easy updates to the database schema and the language model, enabling continuous improvement of the chatbot's performance.
- **Scalability**: The modular design allows for scaling individual components (e.g., adding more database instances or language model APIs) as needed.

## Conclusion
The RAG over SQL architecture provides a powerful framework for building chatbots that can leverage structured data while also utilizing advanced language models for enhanced conversational capabilities. This approach is suitable for applications requiring both factual accuracy and contextual understanding.
